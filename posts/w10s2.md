## Building my portfolio
If you haven't already, write a first draft of your artist or designer bio. In tandem with this, focus on how you can use various visual elements to express your interests and tastes as an artist or designer.

I personally love the 8-bit styles of Papers-Please and Undertale and I felt that my Self-Portrait 'video game' also matches this aesthetic. I also felt my previous designs were a bit too modern and gimmicky for my personal style. I take pride in being a bit left-of-centre and this style I feel encapsulates that well. Further the backgreound is the normal of a 3D texture I made for unity, which ties in my love for games and also assignment 3. There are social media links fixed at the top for ease of access and the pixel art sun and star are fixed on screen as well to frame the webpage, and to show my interest in 3D landscape creation and landscape photography. The working bio reads: "videographer, unity lover, graphic designer and system abolisher with a love for creating design inspired by a dystopian reality." which I feel is a good short and snappy way of identifying what I do and why.
