## A comprehensive explanation of my intention with each asset, sfx, layout etc. in my world.

**The Log Cabin**

The log cabin serves as the central point of the environment, symbolizing a sense of confinement. It represents the home that became both a sanctuary and a prison during lockdown. Its rustic, isolated appearance conveys a sense of being cut off from the outside world, emphasizing the solitude I felt. Log cabins are also a trope in classic horror films and games as a place where one might be 'attacked', in this case symbolising the threat of COVID, horror tropes being a major inspiration of the environment.

**The Bed**

The bed inside the cabin is a symbol of the constant cycle of waking up and going to sleep in the same place, day after day. It signifies the blurring of boundaries between reality and dreams, and highlights the monotony of life during quarantine. It is placed centrally, not up against any walls like a regular bedroom to symbolically represent the feeling of displacement and erraticness that I was conditioned to in that room. Further, it being the only object in the room symbolises the feeling of nothing to do, my world confined to room-rotting in that bed.

**The Red Light**

The red light in the cabin represents the heightened anxiety and alertness we experienced during the pandemic. It casts an eerie glow, inspired by horror tropes and specifically the lighting plot from 'The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals", which is a musical by team Starkid, where the singing and dancing zombies' identities are revealed through a red spotlight. This light creates an unsettling atmosphere that mirrors the threat of the virus, which is often characterised as a red entity, and the constant state of vigilance it imposed on our lives.

**The Virus**

A representation of the virus is included to make the invisible threat tangible. It serves as a reminder of the constant danger lurking outside, reinforcing the feelings of fear and uncertainty that permeated our daily existence. See more in last blog post.

**The Floating Trees**

The floating trees add a surreal, dreamlike quality to the environment, symbolizing the disconnection from reality many people felt. They represent the suspension of normalcy, as our usual routines and interactions were upended, leaving us in a state of limbo. Initially these trees were a mistake ad could have been easily removed and fixed, but as I navigated my space, I noticed it forced the player to double take, questioning the 'reality' of the digital environment, and furthr adding to the intended confused and on-edge feeling I wanted to evoke.

**The Normal Trees**

In contrast to the floating trees, the normal trees symbolize the aspects of life that remained constant and grounding. They offer a touch of familiarity and stability in an otherwise disrupted world, representing hope and the eventual return to normalcy. Most of these trees were selected due to their similarity  to the trees in my hometown, Geelong, specifically the trees down in the park I used to walk in when we were allowed '30 minutes of outdoor exercise a day'. I could have easily had *all* the trees floating but I felt that would take away from the "double take" nature of the floating ones as previously described.

**The Rocks**

The rocks scattered around the landscape signify obstacles and challenges faced during the pandemic. They are metaphors for the various hurdles—health concerns, financial difficulties, or mental health struggles—that we had to navigate through. Specifically they almost block the house, a warning as not to go inside, foreshadowing not only the ending of the environment but also the end of normalcy.

**The Mountains**

The mountains in the background represent the daunting journey and the long, uphill battle against the pandemic. They stand as symbols of resilience and endurance, reminding us of the strength required to overcome such significant challenges.

**The Normal Trees**

In contrast to the floating trees, the normal trees symbolize the aspects of life that remained constant and grounding. They offer a touch of familiarity and stability in an otherwise disrupted world, representing hope and the eventual return to normalcy.

**Indoor Music**

The indoor music is carefully chosen to evoke a sense of melancholy and introspection. It is slow and somber, mirroring the internal reflection and the range of emotions we experienced while being confined indoors.

**Outdoor Music**

The outdoor music contrasts with the indoor music, featuring sounds of nature and a more uplifting melody. It signifies freedom and the longing for the outside world, providing a stark contrast to the isolation inside the cabin. This duality highlights the dichotomy between the confined indoor space and the liberating outdoors.

I have put a lot of thought into the intention behind each element of this Unity project. I wanted this digital environment to be more than just a visual representation, a emotional and psychological exploration of what isolation during COVID-19 felt like and the transformation between what we considered normal, to our new reality.
