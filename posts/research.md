# 'THIS IS NOT A GUN' Cara Levine

The main artwork that has inspired my icons is titled "This is Not a Gun", a ceramic work by artist Cara Levine.
It is almost a window into to the pitfalls of humanity, where systemic racism and police brutality have formed our legacy. 

Levine's exhibition features handcrafted ceramics of objects that police mistookÂ for guns in shootings of unarmed individuals, the majority of whom were black. The endeavour is divided into three parts: the carvings created in her studio, public workshops with colleagues, and, most recently, a book of essays and images by 40 artists and writers, of which I have had the pleasure of reading. The book is a somber and mournful collection of memories and stories through the facade of simple objects, that made me angry, at the world, at humanity. The thought came to me "this is what we leave behind", our *legacy*, what do we leave behind. Each object was a memory, a shopping list item and piece of that person's life, their legacy reduced down to a sandwich in the shape of a gun in the eyes of those who swore to protect us.

*"The legacy and effects of biased policing are far reaching. The U.S. is home to the world's largest prison population and the highest per-capita incarceration rate. As of May 2020, there were 655 people incarcerated per 100,000. Prison, parole, and probation operations cost U.S. taxpayers $81 billion a year."*
