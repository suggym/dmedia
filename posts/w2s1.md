**BLACK SQUARES** 

Although initially thumbnail sketching slowly, and struggling for ideas, by applying the skills learnt through the tutorial I managed to not only quicken my pace but also improve the quality of my creations.

By using my subconscious to guide me in the creation of each logo, resulted in the creation of logos non-linearly, instead picking a category as ideas came to me. This alleviated the pressure of creating 8 from the same prompt and allowed me to express new ideas.

By putting the squares together subconsciously, I unknowingly discovered that I could make some familiar shapes, the RMIT logo, the castle and the side profile of a man all being complete accidents. Two of these ended up as my favourite for their category, illustrating the power of the subconscious for creativity.

**PROMPT CHOICE**

The prompt that appeals to me the most is “Legacy” or ‘what we leave behind’ as it can be broadly interpreted in global, intrapersonal and individual manners. My main idea is within the context of icons for categories on a grocery shopping website on google that has been hacked, to show the ‘legacy’ of our most environmentally, and individually harmful common products.
