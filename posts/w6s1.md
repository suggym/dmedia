# SOUND
To provide the context for the icons, "police sounds" such as sirens, commands and gunshots were essential in conveying the message of a violent legacy, which would be too difficult to source in the wild. Thankfully all the sounds I required could be downloaded royalty free through the RMIT library. Coding the sounds to play in html was simpler than I thought it would be and I was able to code in all my sounds, with some trial and error, over a short amount of time.

# MY PROGRESS

Over the last 1.5 weeks, I have made considerable progress on my icons, developing a flat design style I frankly was not aware I could create. Illustrator has come suprisingly natural to me, despite having never used it before this class, and I hope in the future I can continue to build my graphic design skills using this program. On the 26th I had done two thirds of the icons, finishing them the next day. As seen in the second picture, I ended up using customised square artboards to export my designs to maximise consistency in size and layout, and also automate naming systems.

# ORGANISATION AND VSC

As well as developing skills in design, I have also developed organisational and coding skills to maximise efficiency, using naming systems to create copy and paste code that can be simply edited. I have found that for me, with this amount of icons, using numbers rather than words maximised my efficiency, effectively coding all sound and image changes within 5 minutes. There were a few bugs that popped up, such as at one point the image would change but the sound would not play, for only one icon. However, I managed to decipher the code enough to fix all errors that occured, and my confidence in reading code has become much stronger as a result.
