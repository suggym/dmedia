# HTML PRACTISE BLOG

Being about halfway through my assignment, I came to the realization that I had not finalised a colour scheme for the animated second icon. Below are some experiments- mainly deliberating between the use of black and white to signify mourning and death, or alternatively, employing brighter and more saturated colours to convey more alarming and dangerous connotations. Both palettes ultimately aim to shock and evoke empathy in lawmakers and middle-class citizens for the victims of these police 'mistakes'. Our 'legacy' as a human race is holistically dependent on our actions, our institutions and our philosophies, and I endeavor to convey a distinct criticism of humanity's legacy with violence by those who are to employed to protect us. This may involve the use of a blood splatter effect or red and blue to symbolically reference the police force.

I had considerable challenges with html due to my lack of coding experience, but with a (fair amount) of trial and error I was successfully able to change the images in VS Code, and also successfully changed the margins of the table in the code to fit a web-based layout properly and ensuring the sizes were optimal for my icons.
