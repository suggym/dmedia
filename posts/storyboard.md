# Storyboarding and Continuity
## w02s1


## continuity and editing discussion
To maintain spatial continuity I will shoot in order to ensure the messy room is exactly the same per shot, ensuring both time and space continuity, however slightly diverging from through through the jumpcuts of the posters on the wall. These JC's will ultimately show a discontinual timeline and establishing that I am moving in quickly. These quick cuts and jump cuts in my editing will contribute heavily to the slightly goofy, cartoonish and exciting feeling I am trying to establish through this piece, and ultimately describing the contentness of how busy and messy life is in Melbourne for me.
