# VIDEO DRAFT AND PITCH

## w3
 video:

This video conceptualises my moving out process as a video game, symbolic of not only the structure I like to have but also my low points, when I 'end a game' or a task prematurely. Using a vector subjet to play me,I will express how my video games and distractions ultimately make my life more complex and messy.
