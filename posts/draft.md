# VIDEO DRAFT AND PITCH

 video: https://youtu.be/IhI6xmrf2js

This short film conceptualises the process of moving out as a video game, representing both my low points—when I "end a game" or a task prematurely—and the structure I prefer to have. I will use a vector subjet to represent myself as I explain how diversions ultimately make my life more complicated and disorganised and how I metaphorically attribute my lack of productivity to outside factors— a dread that has followed me when I moved out and started college. The production aims to convey my sense of self through my possessions, my choices, and my arrangement of objects through playful chaos and somewhat slapstick comedy.
