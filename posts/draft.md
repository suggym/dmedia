# VIDEO DRAFT AND PITCH

The process of making this draft was quite tedious not in the video editing or shooting but in the compilation of and referencing of a plethora of SFX which were needed to contribute to what I have named the 'chaos sequence' of this video. SFX were used to bring to life the 'video game' feeling and putting these objectively simplistic shots into context to create a different world/reality from our own. I started by shooting all scenes which included Alvin, who would play 'me', as he was on limited schedule, then moving onto shooting the rest of the shots sequentially, adding a few more (not in the storyboard) when I came up with ideas. I then spliced the opening sequence according to the music I had picked out, making sure everything was on time with the music. Lastly I assembled the rest of the shots, and layers the sound on top of them, finally ending up with the video above. Overall it was a successful and efficient process leaving time for lots of touch-ups and minor details in the next couple of days. Things I want to improve include getting rid of any time interpolation (against rules of task), and cleaning up the quality of or reshooting that last flashing light scene with Alvin, to ensure quality is consistent throughout.
