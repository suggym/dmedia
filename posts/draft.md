# VIDEO DRAFT AND PITCH

 video: https://youtu.be/IhI6xmrf2js

The process of making this draft was quite tedious not in the video editing or shooting but in the compilation of and referencing of a plethora of SFX which were needed to contribute to what I have named the 'chaos sequence' of this video. SFX are used to bring to life the 'video game' feeling and putting these objectively simplistic shots to create a different world/reality from our own. I started by shotting all the scenes including Alvin, who would play 'me', as he was on limited schedule, then moving onto shooting the rest of the shots sequentially, adding a few more (not in the storyboard) when I came up with ideas. I then spliced the opening sequence according to the music I had picked out, making sure everything was on time with the music. Lastly I assembled the rest of the shots, and layers the sound on top of them, finally ending up with the video above. Overall it was a successful and efficient process leaving time for lots of touch-ups and minor details in the next couple of days.
