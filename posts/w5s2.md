# HTML PRACTISE BLOG

Being about halfway through my assignment, I realised I haven't finalised a colour scheme for the animated second icon. Below are some experiments- mainly tossing up between black and white to signify mourning and death, or alternatively brighter and more saturated colours for a more alarming, warning and dangerous connotations, both ultimately aiming to shock and evoke empathy in law makers and middle class citizens for the victims of these police 'mistakes'. 

I could not figure out how to deploy my html but with a (fair amount) of trial and error I was successfully able to change the images in VS Code, and also successfully changed the margins of the table in the code to fit a web-based layout properly and for the sizing that best fits my icons.
