# SHORT VIDEO HW

## w03s1

**KEY MOMENTS**
The climax or main tension point of my video is the chaos of the room coming to life and the main character waking up to find the room a mess after "ending the game" of unpacking their room. The create this tension I will use a crescendo of 'silly' SFX (boings, video game noises, beeps etc.) as well as non-diegetic tense video game music, all in tandem with visual elements such as flashing lighting, quick cuts and lots of movement of objects. This combination of sound and visual components ultimately will create the most stressful room of all time, forcing the character to wake up. This build-up of tension is also symbolic of the self made chaos/ depression room I often find myself in, despite trying to be tidy, further highlighting the stress of moving and starting uni. This crescendo of sound and movement will be juxtaposed when the character's eyes open. This section will have no sound and very little cutting and movement to not only accentuate the heightened tension from before, but also conceptualise the notion of being overwhelmed, but being unable to pinpoint where it is coming from. Overall the juxtaposition between the hellish fast-paced editing and loud chaotic noise and the slient long still shots will create a very bipolar feeling for the audience, feeling extreme stress only to immediately stop- ultimately hinting at my mood swings, describing that portion of myself and how they control me.
