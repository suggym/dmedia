# Brainstorming phase

This digital environment will explore how (nicotine) addiction has changed me throughout high school both mental and physical means, shown in the DE as metaphorical light and colour symbolism to reresent emotion and more literal objects to give context. It will follow a chronological linearity and explore the transformation between watching my mother attempt to secretly smoke cigarettes in my childhood to 'becoming her' as an adult.

## NEW IDEA ##
Apparently it is extremely difficult to find free smoke assets for unity, which was the basis and crux of my first idea. However, after reconsideration, I feel that my experience with the transition to COVID-19 isolation is much more transferrable to an audience and will evoke a much more visceral and empathic response. The concept includes the player travelling through a beautiful lush landscape, with not much to do, but at the end of the road the player finds a cabin, which they enter. The cabin houses a singular bed and after text appears saying "There is no escape", they realise they cannot exit the house. This metaphorically and explicitly represents the feeling of being trapped during covid 19. I may also include a little virus asset that follows the player and encourages them to go inside the cabin. For the colour palette I will use a sunset purple and green to empahsise the beauty of the sunset lanscape, and a red alarming spotlight inside the cabin to contrast this sense of peace.

## Planets task
Despite my unity experience being non-existent, I quickly got the hang of the basic tools and folder management. I am still in the process of working out how to input assets. 

**Progress:**
