## Brainstorming phase

This digital environment will explore how (nicotine) addiction has changed me throughout high school both mental and physical means, shown in the DE as metaphorical light and colour symbolism to reresent emotion and more literal objects to give context. It will follow a chronological linearity and explore the transformation between watching my mother attempt to secretly smoke cigarettes in my childhood to 'becoming her' as an adult.

* A written and/or visual breakdown of how your environment will change or evolve over the journey, and how this connects to your concept. This can include visual references such as your colour palette(s), inspiration, and so on.
* A simple map of your environment, produced either traditionally or digitally, that shows how the user will move through the space. This should show how you will use elements such as landmarks, framing, pattern and contrast, etc.
