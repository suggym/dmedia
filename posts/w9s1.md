Since last post I have added:
- A flickering red spotlight using C# code to add a sense of eeriness to the cabin.
- A Covid virus with red particles that 'chases' the player throughout the whole experience (still trying to figure out how to stop the virus from travelling through the terrain) in order to give the player a reason not to look around the environment- a symbol of the lack of appreciation I had for nature before COVID began.

- Creepier light
- Rocks
- More trees on outskirts to make the terrain appear ongoing and expansive.
- Code to turn of the directional light once player enters the house to emphasise the red spotlight.

Here is my friend Jackson playing my digital environment. Without the path he struggled to find the house due to the blockage by the trees and I did have to mention there was more to the game. He was freaking out about the COVID following him the entire time which made me very happy. He did try to escape the house which was funny and exactly the way I intended. Overall a good playtest with some minor errors.

Moving forward I intend to add a path leading though the trees as a clue and also some eery music attached to the virus to add an extra layer of creepy. I would also like to add a fade to black end card once a player has tried to escape (maybe once the player has touched all four of the physic material planes?) to signify the end. I also want to add more aspects for a player to potentially miss out on, like grazing animals etc.
