## Collaboration and Finalisation

From Curtis's feedback, I saw that the white outline that marked the Youtube video widgets looked odd next to the non-outlined photo, a quick fix to give the photo a white outline for consistency.

I was also intially unsure of the photography sections with the slightly chaotic intersecting lines, however after asking around I found that the layout, despite being chaotic "flowed surprisingly well" prompting me to keep that layout.

My mother pointed out that she didn't know she could click on the icons above my name to scroll to that section, so I added one of the pixelated cursors to one of them icons to prompt audiences to use the buttons for ease of navigating the site.

I also added a sound design panel along with the photography one as I feel like sound design has been a vital underlying theme to all of this year's work, and it felt wrong not to mention the songs I wrote for some of my assignments.

Today I also completed the iphone layout version, which was surprisingly difficult as the format is so much smaller, and most of my elements will not shrink on select.
