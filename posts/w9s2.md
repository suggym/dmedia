*The thumbnail I made for the unity play build :)*

Over the week I have managed finalise the game so it truly matches my intention.

**Updates:**
---
- Added clock ticking SFX and not an asset, as to add to a sense of impending doom, enchanced by not being able to see to source of the ticking. The interior sound is now coded to only turn on when player enters house and outdoor music and SFX likewise are coded to turn off at the trigger event.

- Added red, glowing particle effect to make the virus even more ominous and further added a distorted noise SFX, it's runoff created to specifically drown out the peaceful music when it gets closer to the player. 

**SIDENOTE!!!!**

I can see the feedback now Thomas, "it's too obvious, it's too explicit, use other means of portraying your intention Mia!" but I whole-heartedly disagree. The point of it's explicitness is to not only draw inspiration from modern, cheap, roblox-style horror games- which were at their height during the pandemic, but also the explicitly remind the player that COVID specifically, is still around and still exists, and we seldom remember this fact in 2024, where I feel the events of 2020 and 2021 are still being brushed over despite the number of lives lost in the pandemic. There needs to be a specific reminder because we have all distanced ourselves from that era in extreme volumes, and the image of *the* coronavirus is meant to spark memories of all those news reports and articles we have so long forgotten about. The virus in itself could not just be a metaphor or a silly abstract implication for the player to discover but a really distinct (and slightly terrifying) reminder to be grateful, so so so grateful, we are able to enjoy life as how it once was, today.

- Added a fade to black which was suprisingly easy to code, where after the player has been in the house for 20 seconds, the screen fades to black. This is a common connotation for "the end" in most movies and games and in my specific environment it is symbolic of how isolation truly did feel like 'the end' of the world, of life and of society. Through the fade to black I can emphasise the difference between endless landscape and 'the end' and the feeling of entrapment that I felt during lockdown.

- More trees! More Plants!

- Added a path in case a player got lost with a 3d pavement texture from quixel. This solidifies the players navigation whilst also created an 'abandoned' feel to the environment, which is symbolic of, and foreshadowing the feeling of life right after lockdown.

- More bird and insect sounds to bring the trees and plants to life and make it a truly immersive experience.
