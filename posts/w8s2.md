Using garage band I recorded some music to use in my environment, the first one being a peaceful guitar loop with light drums to create a peaceful terrain. However once the player reaches the house, a loud orchestral string piece wil, play, using bass drums to replicate a rapidly increasing heartbeat, to create a sense of anxiety in the house. In game, the first sound has no doppler effect whilst the in-house sound has maximum doppler effect as to create a sense of disorientation and creepiness to the house. As well as these two music pieces I have also added a forest ambience sound effect throughout the environment, includoing insect, bird and wind sounds to contextualise the tree and terrain.

## Troubleshooting
So far I have been unsuccessful in my quest to add water into my environment as all assets and tutorials I watch have made little sense to me and tend to crash my laptop. This means I may have to find other ways to make the environment visually captivating and realistic.

I did change my tree assets so I could have some variety whilst still maintaining the same "style" as well as adding some animated foliage and flowers which worked really nicely. I found these assets worked better in aesthetic and added movement and realism to the scene.

I also managed to create a material which would allow the player to go through it one way, but be solid the other way using 2D physic material setting on some invisible planes within the imported log cabin, this allowed me to create a house which one could enter but not escape successfully.

Some of the trees stand in the way of the ideal path but ideally I would like the player to go through them. Therefore I may paint an actual stone path onto the terrain to clue in the player on where they should go.

Further I believe the last thing I will do (to avoid annoyance whilst I playtest) is to reduce the player speed and force the user to appreciate the scenery as the walk.
