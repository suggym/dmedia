Some other interesting/good tips for considering how you can increase design thinking around web accessibility in general can be found hereLinks to an external site.. 

2. Revisit the wireframes that you generated after the last session, and consider how they could be improved with a grid-based layout in a blog post. A useful article on the benefits of such a layout can be found hereLinks to an external site.. 

3. Continue to implement the content of the website according to your wireframes, and document this process as you go on your blog. Make sure you maintain good design practice in the arrangement of your text and media elements, as outlined in this document 

4. In the same post, compare the current iteration of your webpage with the version that you originally envisioned, and reflect on any differences between them. What's changed, and what's remained the same? Have you had to make any concessions, or have you managed to implement everything that you wanted to?
