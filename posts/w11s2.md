Using WebAim's colourt contrast plugin I was able to see that the purple background and white text did not contrast enough to make the website wholly accessible and readable, however bychanging the background colour to a cornflower blue, correct contrast was achieved and it also added more to the childlike feel of the website, the blue like a sky to support the sun and cloud overlayed pixel art. 

Using a grid was not the best for my chaotic, childlike website, although it did somewhat help with spacing, ultimately the grid lines hindered my overall childlike, chaotic aesthetic.
Although I could only source 1 pixelated font on FIGMA, I have used size and form to suggest visual hierarchy, the titles capitalised and far larger than the body text. The visuals are central and larger than the sun/clouds overlay to also suggest visual hierarchy. 

Unfortunately much of the animation and interactive fun elements are impossible with figma within this timeframe, so I have settled for the elements that were originally going to be animated to stay fixed to the screen as a sort of overlay that contributes to the fun, cut and paste style.

Compared to my first iteration, I much prefer this new one as I feel like it fits more into whatever niche my design belongs to, the old one appearing more trendy corporate than I'd like. The new design still incorporates bright, saturated colours but in a more subtle way so that the non-colour matched images still feel unified with the rest of the page's design. 

I was not able to include the abstract shape elements I had included in the first design, due to the shapes looking odd when pixelised, and not cohesive without pixelisation. However, by replacing those shapes with pixelated icons, the website feels much more childlike, cut and paste style, and further much more personable than the very instagram trend-like shapes.

Overall I much prefer my new design as I feel it is more aligned with the style of my assignments and my interests as well as being chaotic but not busy unlike the first iteration.
