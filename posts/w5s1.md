# ICON COLOURING AND COLOUR THEORY

In all I found a simple brown colour palette with red as a contrasting hightlight worked the best- as the red allowed me to create more emphasis and dominance over the important aspects of each design, or in the tshirt's case, imply dimension despite the 'flat' form. The harmony of the slightly muted warm browns and red feels quite homely, like the colours you might see in a winter cabin, or at christmas, which effectively symbolises the homely shopping list context I am attempting to portray.
