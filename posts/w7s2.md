In my greybox prototype I have used the negative space where hills are not, to guide the user through to the house at the end. This form-void relationship forces users to navigate the space as intended, and to ultimately reach the climax or destination of the digital environment. Based on feedback I received through playtesting I have gained a few ideas for next steps with my digital environment. 

Proportion: Ensure that the scale of elements in your environment, such as the hills and the house, conveys the intended sense of journey and confinement. The hills could gradually increase in size or steepness to symbolize the challenges faced during lockdown, leading to the imposing presence of the house.

Form/Void Relationships: Use the form of the hills and the voids between them to create a sense of progression and enclosure. As the player moves closer to the house, the voids could become narrower or more claustrophobic, emphasizing the feeling of being trapped.

Clock: Incorporate a prominent clock within the house or in a central location visible from various points in the environment. The clock should be designed to visually indicate the passage of time, perhaps by having the hands move slowly or by showing different lighting conditions to represent different times of day.

Texture: Add texture to the environment to enhance the eerie atmosphere. This could include weathered surfaces, moss-covered rocks, or tangled vegetation. I will also pay attention to lighting and shadows to further enhance the texture and create a more immersive experience.

Nature Elements: Integrate more natural elements into the environment to reduce the space-like feel. This could involve adding trees, bushes, or other vegetation to create a more organic and grounded environment. Consider using subtle visual cues, such as changing colors or sounds, to indicate the transition from the natural terrain to the more artificial or confined space of the house.

Here are some tree assets I imported as well as I how I have so far used lighting to express time and place and create immersiveness. I have also imported a bed and a log cabin.
