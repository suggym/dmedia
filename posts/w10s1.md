## Assignment 1 - Video Self Portrait

- How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of
your edit?


- How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?


- What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how
did you apply this knowledge to your project?


-  How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use
these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?


- Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to
depict in your portrait?


- What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your
work?


## Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons

- How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose
the theme that you did?


- Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed
across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?


- How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator?
Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?


- How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why
did you choose the palette that you did?


- How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design
correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?


- How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of
concrete visual designs?



## Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment

- How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that
process?


- How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment
differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional
media?


- What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and
different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?


- How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your
use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?


- How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme
or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?


- What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have
discovered otherwise?

## Webpage Brainstorming and Structure
Consider which pieces of process documentation and reflection will best communicate your personal, technical, and conceptual progress across the semester so far. 

Begin to plan out the overall structure of your webpage, and consider how you will distribute this information across a timeline of the semester. Summarise this thought process in a blog post, and include responses to the following questions:

     - What kind of key words do you want the user to associate with the aesthetics of your webpage?
     - Who is the target audience?
     - What features will your audience want to see in your final webpage design?
