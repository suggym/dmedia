## Assignment 1 - Video Self Portrait

- How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of
your edit?

Throughout my self-portrait the sonic components were ultimately the key to creating 'video game' context and aesthetic qualities to the video. I knew from the beginning that the video, although with no 'video-game-like' FX, and based on real life footage, that the self portrait would ultimately somewhat rely on sound to portray my intention- that life felt delusional and unreal once I had moved out. In the video the visuals and SFX are symbiotic in nature.

- How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?

Based on as storyboard that detailed thew crucial aspects of my moving out process, I used my own new room to create each shot, using my friend Alvin to play 'me'- only using is eyes and hand to portray this. The random objects are objects are are very personal to me and because of this, chosen by me to take to Melbourne when I moved. Each shot is a tribute to my old home and how I cultivated my space to make it feel like one.

- What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how
did you apply this knowledge to your project?

I learnt a lot about the line between chaotic noise and unbearable noise and how these both shape the emotional experience of visual content. Unbearable noise can take away from visuals and cause a user to lose focus on the message whereas chaotic noise in my video created the intended anxiety and stress that would compliment the equally chaotic visual journey near the end of the video.

-  How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use
these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?

Editing in time with the music I used single timesignature pacing with each cut to create a peaceful and stable feeling in the beginning, sometimes moving the cuts off-beat to symbolise the 'cracks' of instability showing. However, for the 'chaos sequence' I used double-time pacing of cuts to create a sense anxiety, but still order in the editing. Initially the cuts alter time by cutting out  unimportant visual imformation and going from each action point to the next. However as the video goes on, the speed of the cuts is used to travel quixkly through time, to show the a night has passed in the world of the film.

- Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to
depict in your portrait?
 
I chose to depict the things I look upon as positive aspects of my life such as video games, love of movies, art and fashion to display my optimism about moving out and symbolically showing how despite moving I am still the same person I always have been.


- What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your
work?

I used light, pastel colour grading to mimick the likes of wholesome no-pressure indie-games such as Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing, both of which I was addicted to during Orientation Week as I avoided making friends. These was also lots of colour to not only express hope, but also chaos later in the video.

## Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons

- How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose
the theme that you did?

Each icon is an object that has been mistaken for a gun by police, which has resulted in an innocent person's death. The context presents more like an online shopping list- maybe for a family or young couple, and how these seemingly innocuous items can result in innocent deaths in a police-overfunded system.

- Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed
across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?

Yes, for the theme "legacy" my first iteration was more like a grocery store website hacked by environmentalists, where items such as milk or eggs would reveal the animal's suffering behind their creation, however, refining this idea, I narrowed down this approach to a concept I am much more passionate about.

- How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator?
Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?

Originally my thumbnail sketches used thick harsh lines, but when creating my designs it was not only easier but more aesthetically pleasing to not use stroke lines around the vector shapes as they created a much smoother composition that was more aligned with my personal style.

- How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why
did you choose the palette that you did?

I used brown and red for the first icons and greyscale and red for the second to really illustrate the contrast between the homely red and the red that mens blood, symbolic of how each object has 2 different contexts.

- How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design
correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?

I tried to use punchy, short sounds (without clicks) to not only shock and scare the audience but also to align with the visual communication design where the icons would immediately swap to bloodied icons on mouse enter. Each sound followed a similar thematic direction and also had normalised peaks to ensure cohesion betweene each sound. Similarly the visual elements and principals of my icon design, including colour and line were also 'normalised' to create unity between each icon as well as form to ensure a recurring theme throughout each icon.

- How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of
concrete visual designs?

From 'Legacy' I began to disaggregate the word and what it means not only abstractly and in society, but most importantly by figuring out what 'legacy' meant to me and my own personal experiences. I found that the idea of 'what we leave behind' as a human race was what was most important to me. So I began looking at social justice issues that we underheard or undervalued and thus I came across

## Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment

- How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that
process?


- How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment
differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional
media?


- What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and
different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?


- How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your
use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?


- How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme
or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?


- What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have
discovered otherwise?

## Webpage Brainstorming and Structure
Consider which pieces of process documentation and reflection will best communicate your personal, technical, and conceptual progress across the semester so far. 

Begin to plan out the overall structure of your webpage, and consider how you will distribute this information across a timeline of the semester. Summarise this thought process in a blog post, and include responses to the following questions:

     - What kind of key words do you want the user to associate with the aesthetics of your webpage?
     - Who is the target audience?
     - What features will your audience want to see in your final webpage design?
