## Assignment 1 - Video Self Portrait

- How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?

*In my self-portrait, the sonic elements were crucial in establishing a 'video game' context and aesthetic, despite the absence of video-game-like FX and the use of real-life footage. From the outset, I knew that sound would be essential in conveying my intention: that life felt delusional and unreal once I had moved out- much like beiung immersed in a game or digital realm. The visuals and SFX in the video work symbiotically to portray my theme.*

- How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?

*Guided by a storyboard detailing the key aspects of my moving-out process, I used my new room as the main setting for every shot. My friend Alvin played 'me,' using only his eyes and hands to represent 'me'. The objects featured in the video are personal belongings I chose to take with me when I moved to Melbourne. Each shot serves as a tribute to my old home and reflects how I worked hard to make my new space feel like home.*

- What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?

*I learned about the fine line between chaotic noise and unbearable noise and how each can shape the emotional experience of a video. Unbearable noise can detract from visuals and cause audiences to lose focus on the intended message, whereas chaotic noise in my video created an intended amount of anxiety and stress, complementing the equally chaotic visual journey near the end, and not taking away from the visuals either.*

- How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?

*Attempting to edit in sync with the music, I employed single-time signature pacing with each cut to create a peaceful and stable feeling at the beginning. Occasionally, I moved cuts off-beat to symbolise 'cracks' of instability. For the 'chaos sequence,' I used double-time pacing to create a sense of anxiety while maintaining some order in the editing. Initially, the cuts transition quickly between action points, but as the video progresses, the speed of the cuts accelerates, representing the passage of night in the film. This helped me to convey a sense of time distortion, reflecting my own perception of time during this transition period of my life.*

- Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait?

*I chose to depict the positive aspects of my life, such as my love for video games, movies, art, and fashion. These elements symbolise my optimism about moving out and demonstrate that, despite the change in where I consider 'home', I remain the same person I always have been.*

- What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work?

*I used light, pastel colour grading to mimic the aesthetic of wholesome, no-pressure indie games like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing, both of which I played extensively during O-Week to avoid social interaction. The video also features vibrant colours and high saturation to express not only hope for the future, but also a sense of nostalgic and bittersweet childishness, feeling as if I was learning to 'walk' again in my new place.*

## Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons

- How would you summarize your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?

E*ach icon represents an object mistaken for a gun by police, resulting in an innocent person's death. The icons are presented in the context of an online shopping list, highlighting how these seemingly innocuous items can lead to tragic outcomes in a police-overfunded system.*

- Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?

*Yes, my first iteration for the theme "legacy" depicted a grocery store website hacked by environmentalists, revealing the suffering behind common grocery items like milk and eggs, revealing the cow and the chicken. However, refining this idea, I focused on a concept I am more passionate about: the tragic consequences of systemic police violence.**

- How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?

*Initially, my thumbnail sketches used thick, black stroke lines to outline each icon and define it's features. However, in the final designs, I found that omitting stroke lines around the vector shapes created a smoother composition that aligned better with my personal style, as well as making the icons seem innocous and non-harsh, in order to shock the viewer once the true message is inferred.*

- How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why did you choose the palette that you did?

*I used brown and red for the first icons and greyscale and red for the second to highlight the contrast between homely warm maroon and the blood-red symbolizing death. This colour choice underscores the dual nature of the objects: their everyday harmlessness and their horrific potential for deadly misinterpretations.*

- How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?

*I used punchy, short sounds to shock and scare the audience, aligning with the visual communication design where icons immediately transform into bloodied versions on mouse hover. Each sound followed a cohesive thematic direction and had normalized peaks for consistency. Similarly, the visual elements and principles, including colour and line, were 'normalized' to ensure unity across the icons, reinforcing the recurring theme.*

- How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?

*For the prompt 'Legacy,' I explored its abstract and societal meanings, ultimately focusing on what 'legacy' meant to me. I was inspired by social justice issues and the artwork "This is Not a Gun" by Cara Levine. Levine's work demonstrated how complex concepts like police brutality could be conveyed through simple, recognisable objects, motivating me to create these icons.*

## Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment

- How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that
process? 

*A working prototype was semi-important to my process as it allowed me to carve out the exact path I wanted the player to take in unity, however since the experience was more about the overall aesthetic and randomised terrain components such as grass and trees, it wasn't my top reference point when creating my environment.*

- How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment
differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional
media?

*I found that designing 2D media was much easier but also much less rewarding then 3D design. With 2D media there is little room for error as minor details are easy to account for given only an X and Y plane to work with. However, with 3D design, it is easy to view your work from one angle and see it as correct, but not all 360 degrees of view may be accounted for, as well as how the design looks from an in-game distance. For example, editing my unity game from a direct birds-eye-view made the terrain easier to edit as a whole, such as placing mass trees and grass. However, when playtesting I would find that half the trees were floating despite them looking ground level from above.*

- What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and
different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?

*The role of the camera in this project was to be a POV of the player, a controllable agent with which to navigate the space. Similarly, the camera was also used as a first-person POV for the protagonist; 'me'. However, the viewer has absolutely no agency over the actions of the 'player' in my video game based video, and must watch as the events unfold. But despite the notion of agency being established by the controllable POV camera in the unity game, ultimatwly the design of the game also encourages the player to specific ending, not unlike my video, whereby the illusion of agency ultimately forces them into the cabin, concluding the game.*

- How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your 
use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?


- How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme
or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?


- What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have
discovered otherwise?

## Webpage Brainstorming and Structure

- To communicate my progress I should focus on how used the software and scripts to create my designs as previously I have had no experience in them. As I have a lot of video experience and working as a professional photographer snd social media manager currently, I will not need to elaborate as much on my video making progress and can instead link to previous films and related awards.

- I will sort my portfolio by disciplinary area eg. video and photo, graphic design, 3d, sound to not only showcase a variety of skills to future clients, but also an easy way to include all assignments that we are required to include.

- essentials include visual evidence of work, audiences will expect moving asopects and good web design as a precursor for my portfolio and they expect to see some kind of written explanation of who I am and what I do (artist statement + bio)

- the target audience are directors and creatives with ideas they don't know how to bring to life (not corporate clientelle please no) and also established designers with WIP personal projects that have missing components (eg. filmmaker needs soundscape for film).

- I want my portfolio to be associated with words like "fun", "expressive", "colourful", and "quirky"

Maybe too modern/instagram-trendy????? Not really my style. Too 'graphic design major' for me. I do LOVE the bright colours in number 1.
