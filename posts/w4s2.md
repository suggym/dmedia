The most effective in my opinion is No. 18, as the clean straight lines are somewhat synonymous with the corporate context of a supermarket companyâ€™s website, as well as a lack of bright colour to also illustrate this.

However about half-way through choosing what the rest of my icons would be I had a new, more impactful idea. Each icon has now been changed to an object that has been mistaken for a gun by police,which has resulted in an innocent person's death. Now the context presents more like an online shopping list- maybe for a family or young couple, and how these seemingly innocuous items can result in innocent deaths in a police-overfunded system.
Circled below are the designed out of each five that emphasised the simplicity and familiarity of these objects, thin clean lines symolic of a normal and carefree lifestyle I want to portray, creating an extreme contrast between the happy icons and the unintended result of them. I hope I can provoke a middle class family or parents to question how police deal with situations and ultimately discourage the promotion and over-focus on firearms in Police departments altogether. I feel like this idea reflects me as a creative practitioner much more effectively and sheds light on my desire to prompt controversial and difficult (but needed) conversation through the media I create.
