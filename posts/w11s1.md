## Wireframe Practise Activity

I surprisingly did not forget a whole lot about the 'Papers, Please' UI which was good. I used red for interactive UI and greys for non-interactive.

## First Wireframe 'Minimalist': 

This WF is very simple with a modern corporate looking left/right alignment.

## Second Wireframe 'Maximalist/Fun': 

This WF would have a lot more scattered visual content and a central alignment, which to me appears less corporate and less formal than the previous left/right alignment.
